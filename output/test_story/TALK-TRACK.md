## Overview

This demo shows how SimTreeNav tracks changes across a manufacturing plant's digital twin data over time. We'll walk through real-world scenarios that manufacturing engineers face daily.

## Timeline Summary

| Step | Event | Changes | Node Count |
|------|-------|---------|------------|
| Baseline | baseline | 0 | 100 |
| Bulk Paste | bulk_paste | 20 | 120 |
| Rename Pass | standardization | 12 | 120 |
| Retouch | transform_adjust | 18 | 120 |
| Restructure | reorganization | 7 | 120 |
| Prototype Swap | prototype_change | 2 | 120 |
| Anomaly | mass_delete | 21 | 99 |
| Recovery | recovery | 8 | 107 |

## Scene-by-Scene Talk Track

### Scene 1: Baseline (Clean State)
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Baseline]**

> "Here's our starting point - a clean snapshot of Plant Alpha with 100 nodes. 
> Notice the hierarchical structure: Stations contain Resource Groups, which contain Robots with their Tools."

**Key points:**
- Explain the node types: Station, ResourceGroup, Resource, ToolInstance, Operation, Location
- Show the tree structure
- Highlight prototype-instance relationships

---

### Scene 2: Bulk Paste Event
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Bulk Paste]**

> "A technician just imported tools from another project - we see a spike of 20 new nodes.
> SimTreeNav detects this as a 'Bulk Paste' intent with high confidence."

**Demo actions:**
- Click on the Intents tab
- Show the "BulkPaste" intent detection
- Highlight the affected subtree

---

### Scene 3: Rename Pass (Standardization)
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Rename Pass]**

> "Engineering standardized naming conventions. Notice how SimTreeNav tracks renames while preserving identity."

**Demo actions:**
- Show renamed nodes with _STD suffix
- Explain identity resolution (same node, different name)
- Point out zero false positives

---

### Scene 4: Retouch Session (Transform Drift)
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Retouch]**

> "Here's where it gets interesting. Someone adjusted tool positions - look at the Drift tab."

**Demo actions:**
- Switch to Drift view
- Show position/rotation deltas
- Explain tolerance thresholds
- Highlight "drifted pairs"

---

### Scene 5: Station Restructure
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Restructure]**

> "Management reorganized resource groups between stations. SimTreeNav tracks the moves."

**Demo actions:**
- Show Move changes
- Explain parent-child tracking
- Demonstrate impact analysis on restructured nodes

---

### Scene 6: Prototype Swap
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Prototype Swap]**

> "Tool prototypes were updated - some instances now point to different master definitions."

**Demo actions:**
- Show link changes
- Explain prototype-instance relationships
- Highlight compliance impact

---

### Scene 7: Anomaly Event (Mass Delete)
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Anomaly]**

> "This is critical - an accidental mass deletion. SimTreeNav immediately flags this as an anomaly."

**Demo actions:**
- Switch to Anomalies tab
- Show Critical severity alert
- Demonstrate the anomaly evidence
- Explain blast radius impact

---

### Scene 8: Recovery
**[CLICK: Timeline -> Recovery]**

> "Partial recovery was performed. SimTreeNav shows which nodes were restored."

**Demo actions:**
- Compare before/after counts
- Show restored nodes
- Demonstrate compliance score recovery

---

## Final Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Snapshots | 8 |
| Final Node Count | 107 |
| Total Changes Tracked | 37 |
| Anomalies Detected | 0 |
| Compliance Score | 100% |

## Q&A Talking Points

1. **"How does identity resolution work?"**
   > We use multiple signals: externalId, name+path, content hash, prototype links. Each has a weight, and we compute a confidence score.

2. **"Is this real-time?"**
   > For demos, we generate synthetic data. In production, we poll the database at configurable intervals (watch mode).

3. **"What about performance with 100k nodes?"**
   > We use streaming writers, paging, and virtualized UI. The viewer caps at 2000 nodes but the full data is in JSON files.

4. **"Can we export this?"**
   > Yes! The bundle is self-contained HTML+JSON. Works offline, no server needed.

---

## Next Steps

- Review the data/ folder for raw JSON exports
- Check manifest.json for bundle contents
- Try the search/filter features in the viewer
